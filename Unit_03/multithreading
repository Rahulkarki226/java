#MutliThreading in java
- MultiThreading in java is process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
-So, Independent work can be executed simultaneously
-MultiThreading in java is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously to maximize
utilization of CPU.

Example: Kitchen, Waiter, Chef
       *waiter will be in ideal situation
       *Main Thread (If no other thread is there , then work will done by only one main method!
       
 Two ways to create a thread in java
    1- By implementing Runnable interface
     - Have to provide override definition of run method
    2- By extending Thread class
       -Have to provide override definition of run method

 *When we call start method, then separate call stack will be created for that
 particular thread
 * When we call run method directly, then it will be stored 
    in current stack[ usually in main method stack]
 * We should not call run method directly, let the JVM execute run() method through start()
  method by creating separate call stack.
  * Otherwise  it will behave as a simple current thread method.
